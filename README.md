# uDCR
Micro direct conversion receiver covering 80m, 40m, 20m bands. Although it is continuously tunable from 3.5MHz to 15MHz the three nominated bands are easy to get to using the band change function.

# How does it work?
The signal at the antenna passes though a pair of back-to-back diodes to protect the rest of the circut from very large signals.
