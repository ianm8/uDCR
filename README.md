# uDCR
Micro direct conversion receiver covering 80m, 40m, 20m bands. Although it is continuously tunable from 3.5MHz to 15MHz the three nominated bands are easy to get to using the band change function. The receiver has faily good large signal handling capability and an effective AGC mechanism. The controls consist of an LED (for frequency readout and signal level) and rotary encoder (for frequency and volume changes) and a pushbutton (used to change frequency step, band and volume setting in conjunction with the rotary encoder).

# How does it work?
The signal at the antenna is capacitively coupled to a pair of back-to-back diodes to protect the rest of the circut from very large signals. Then follows a band-pass filter with a lower frequency cutoff of about 4MHz and a higher frequency cutoff of about 15MHz. The switching mixer responds to the fundamental frequency tuned as well as the third harmonic where signals will be reduced by about 9 db. This means that tuning below about 5Mhz will potentially allow reception of signals at 15Mhz and below but at reduced sensitivity. In the range 3.5Mhz to 4MHz (the 80m amateur band) this corresponds to 10.5Mhz to 12MHz where there are few interfering signals. In practice the 80m band is a nice inclusion without the complexity of switching in an additional filter - even though receiving this band of frequencies is a compromise. From the 40m band and higher there is no issue because the third harmonic of the tuned frequency is well above the filter cutoff in addition to the 9db reduction in sensitivity.

After the filter is a lowcost MMIC RF amplifier and a 50 Ohm PI attenutator with a combined gain of about 9db. This sets the noise figure to about 6db. More than sufficient to receive any signals in the HF spectrum. The mixer is a fast switching bus multiplexer with a balanced output. The mixer is clocked by an MS5351M (SI5351 equivalent) which is configure to the tuned frqueny by the XIAO RP2040 microcontroller. The reference oscillator is generated by a TCXO with a frequency for 27MHz. Because this is a TCXO, no calibartion is required.
