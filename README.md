# uDCR
Micro direct conversion receiver covering 80m, 40m, 20m bands. Although it is continuously tunable from 3.5MHz to 15MHz the three nominated bands are easy to get to using the band change function. The receiver has faily good large signal handling capability and an effective AGC mechanism. The controls consist of an LED (for frequency readout and signal level) and rotary encoder (for frequency and volume changes) and a pushbutton (used to change frequency step, band and volume setting in conjunction with the rotary encoder).

# How does it work?
The signal at the antenna is capacitively coupled to a pair of back-to-back diodes to protect the rest of the circut from very large signals. Then follows a band-pass filter with a lower frequency cutoff of about 4MHz and a higher frequency cutoff of about 15MHz. The switching mixer responds to the fundament frequency tuned as well as the third harmonic where signals will be reduced by about 9 db. This means that tuning below about 5Mhz will potentially allow reception of signals at 15Mhz and below but at reduced sensitivity. In the range 3.5Mhz to 4MHz (the 80m amateur band) this correstonds to 10.5Mhz to 12MHz where there are few interfering signals. In practice the 80m band is a nice inclusion without the complexity of switching in an addiotional filter.
